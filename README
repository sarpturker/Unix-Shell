This project was coded for an introductory CS class. It incorporates knowledge about parent child processes, maintaining input output, files, etc.
The code uses its own implementation for the pwd, cd and exit commands.
It supports the > redirection command, as well as a custom ">+" "advanced redirection" command, which redirects output to the beginning of the file, shifting its current contents.
Does not support other features like piping, >>, etc.
All the errors give a generic error output.
